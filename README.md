# landing-page

This is a project I created from a template provided by The Odin Project.
The purpose of this excercise was to create a website to match the template
I was given. A template was also provided for font sizes and colors.

It was also part of the project to make commits through Github regularly
throughout the process. I had to restart the project because I added a large
video file where the large image is now in the top section of the page. This
wasn't allowed by Github, at least without upgrading. It wouldn't allow me to
commit after this, so I duplicated the directory into a new cloned empty repo
so I wouldn't lose the progress I'd made since the failed commit.

This will be something I'll have to revisit in the future so I'm able to learn
what to do within git when a commit fails or I need to remove files from a repo, as it's a bit beyond my current knowledge at this stage.
